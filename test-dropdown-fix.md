# Testing Dropdown Fix for Employee 10011167

## 🎯 Issue Fixed
- Employee "Sucheta Amit Shevale (10011167)" was appearing in incorrect "Non-Billable = 10 days" dropdown
- This incorrect dropdown option should not exist at report level

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. SQL Query Fix (server/storage.ts line 196)
```sql
-- Fixed inconsistent symbol usage
WHEN DATEDIFF(DAY, ets.LastValidBillableDate, GETDATE()) <= 10 THEN 'Non-Billable ≤10 days'
```

### 2. Frontend Dropdown Options Fix (client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx lines 89-97)
```typescript
nonBillableAgings: [
  'Mixed Utilization',
  'Non-Billable ≤10 days',        // ← Employee 10011167 should appear here
  'Non-Billable >10 days',
  'Non-Billable >30 days', 
  'Non-Billable >60 days',
  'Non-Billable >90 days',
  'No timesheet filled'
]
```
