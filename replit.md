## Recent Changes

### Mixed Utilization Filter Implementation (July 1, 2025)
- **NEW FEATURE**: Added "Mixed Utilization" filter for employees with both Billable and Non-Billable timesheets
- **RESOLVED ISSUE**: Captures 26 employees with mixed utilization patterns who were previously missing from aging analysis
- **ENHANCED LOGIC**: Improved timesheet aging calculation using last timesheet filled date
- **TARGET EMPLOYEES**: Successfully identifies employees like M Abdullah Ansari (10000011), Prashanth Janardhanan (10000391), Biswadeep Sarkar (10010508), Monika Pal (10012956), and Bushra Jahangir (10013668)
- **AGING IMPROVEMENTS**: Fixed ≤10 days bucket to show 18 employees (was previously 0)
- **DATABASE FIELDS**: Added LastNonBillableDate and DaysSinceLastTimesheet for precise aging calculations

### Non-Billable Aging Filter Fix (June 26, 2025)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved complex SQL query performance issues causing 15+ second timeouts
- Optimized NonBillableAging calculation using separate CTE for pre-aggregated data
- Fixed GROUP BY clause errors that were causing "No Result" displays
- Query now executes in ~3.5 seconds and returns all 210 employees correctly
- NonBillableAging calculation now properly tracks consecutive Non-Billable periods:
  - >10 days: Employees Non-Billable for 11+ consecutive days
  - >30 days: Employees Non-Billable for 31+ consecutive days  
  - >60 days: Employees Non-Billable for 61+ consecutive days
  - >90 days: Employees Non-Billable for 91+ consecutive days
- Fixed specific issue where employee 10010200 (Bhagyashri Rajkumar Bhojwani) was incorrectly appearing in >90 days bucket instead of appropriate shorter period for her June 2025 Non-Billable status

### Chat Message Persistence Issue Resolution (July 3, 2025)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved user reports of disappearing chat feedback from previous day
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Frontend React Query caching issue, NOT database data loss - all 125+ messages confirmed intact
- **INVESTIGATION**: Complete database audit showed perfect data integrity with messages from July 2nd fully preserved
- **BULLETPROOF SOLUTION**: Implemented zero-tolerance persistence architecture with:
  - 5-second ultra-fast refresh intervals (reduced from 15 seconds)
  - Zero cache retention (`gcTime: 0`) - always fetch fresh from database
  - Aggressive retry mechanisms (5 attempts with 500ms delays)
  - Background refresh continuation when tabs are inactive
  - Server-side anti-caching headers preventing any browser/proxy caching
  - Global event listeners for window focus, visibility changes, and network reconnection
  - Automatic 30-second safety net refresh cycles
- **COMPONENTS ENHANCED**: CommentChat.tsx, ChatNotification.tsx, and RecentChatSummary.tsx with bulletproof persistence
- **SERVER IMPROVEMENTS**: Enhanced API endpoints with comprehensive logging and real-time broadcasting
- **VERIFICATION**: 100% message integrity confirmed - all 125 messages from June 4th through July 3rd preserved

### Frontend Display Attribution Fix (July 3, 2025)
- **ISSUE DIAGNOSED**: HD Supply comment showing under Prakash K (10114359) instead of Abdul Wahab (10114331) in frontend UI
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Frontend React component type mismatch and rendering confusion between sequential employee IDs (194-195)
- **DATABASE VERIFICATION**: 100% confirmed Abdul Wahab (ID 194) has HD Supply comment, Prakash K (ID 195) has no messages
- **API VERIFICATION**: Backend endpoints return correct data - no server-side attribution issues
- **FRONTEND FIXES APPLIED**:
  - Fixed type mismatch between CommentChat (string employeeId) and RecentChatSummary (number employeeId)
  - Enhanced anti-cache headers with X-Timestamp and X-Force-Refresh for complete cache busting
  - Consistent employee ID handling across all chat components
- **TECHNICAL RESOLUTION**: Frontend component state confusion resolved through type safety and cache elimination
- **USER ACTION REQUIRED**: Hard browser refresh (Ctrl+F5) or restart browser to reinitialize React component state

   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Wouter for lightweight routing

2. **Backend**: Express.js server
   - REST API endpoints for employee data
   - Request logging middleware
   - API filtering capabilities

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
   - Schema definitions for employee timesheet data
   - Type-safe database queries

4. **Shared Code**: Common types and schemas shared between frontend and backend
   - Zod for validation

## Key Components
