## System Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend**: React application built with Vite, using TypeScript for type safety
   - UI components from shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI primitives)
   - TanStack React Query for API data fetching
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Wouter for lightweight routing

2. **Backend**: Express.js server
   - REST API endpoints for employee data
   - Request logging middleware
   - API filtering capabilities

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
   - Schema definitions for employee timesheet data
   - Type-safe database queries

4. **Shared Code**: Common types and schemas shared between frontend and backend
   - Zod for validation

## Key Components

### Frontend Components

1. **App.tsx**: Main application component with router setup
   - Sets up QueryClientProvider for data fetching
   - Configures routing with wouter

2. **Dashboard.tsx**: Main page that displays employee data
   - Fetches employee data using React Query
   - Implements filtering, sorting, and pagination

3. **FilterSection.tsx**: Component for filtering employee data
   - Dropdowns for filtering by department, status, business unit, etc.
   - Reset filter functionality

4. **EmployeeTable.tsx**: Table component that displays employee data
   - Built on top of DataTable component
   - Supports sorting, filtering, and pagination

5. **UI Components**: Extensive set of UI components from shadcn/ui
   - Button, Card, Select, Input, Table, etc.
   - Toast notifications
   - Modal dialogs

### Backend Components

   - Serves static frontend assets from `dist/public`
   - API requests are handled by the Express server

The Replit configuration specifies:
- Node.js 20 as the runtime
- PostgreSQL 16 for the database
- Port 5000 for local development, mapped to port 80 for external access

## Database Schema

The primary database table is `employees` with the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Employee name
- `zohoId`: Unique identifier from Zoho
- `department`: Department name
- `status`: Employee status (Active, Inactive, Pending)
- `businessUnit`: Business unit name
