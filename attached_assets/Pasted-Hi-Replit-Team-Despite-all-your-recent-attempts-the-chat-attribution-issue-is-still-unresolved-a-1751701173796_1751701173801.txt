Hi Replit Team,

Despite all your recent attempts, the chat attribution issue is still unresolved, and Iâ€™m under extreme pressure from senior leadership â€” including the CEO â€” to get this fixed immediately.

ðŸš¨ Summary of the Ongoing Issue:
Chat messages are still not correctly attributed to the intended employees (as entered by the sender).

Some comments appear under wrong Zoho IDs or employee names, despite the backend claiming correct mapping.

Certain valid chat comments are not appearing at all in the frontend report.

The Zoho IDs saved in the chat_messages table do not match the Zoho IDs in the Azure SQL database (RC_BI_Database.dbo.zoho_Employee).

There is a clear mismatch or incorrect JOIN/mapping logic between the Postgres chat messages table and Azure SQL Employee data.

ðŸŽ¯ What Needs to Be Done:
Please stop applying only content-based attribution. That is not scalable and not reliable. I need you to:

âœ… Step 1: Replace content-based mapping with ZOHO ID-based mapping

Ensure that the chat_messages.employee_id is matched against zoho_Employee.ZohoID and not id or name-based heuristics.

If your chat messages are using internal IDs, you must align them to actual Zoho IDs by:

Creating a mapping table between Postgres employee_id and Azure SQL ZohoID

Or updating existing chat records to store the correct ZohoID instead of internal IDs

âœ… Step 2: Ensure all data types match and are join-compatible

If the IDs in Azure SQL are BIGINT or VARCHAR and Postgres uses INTEGER, there may be a silent failure in joins â€” please cast accordingly.

Review and correct the foreign key or logical link between chat_messages and employee profiles.

âœ… Step 3: Reprocess all chat message mappings using the correct Zoho IDs

Reprocess all 122+ chat records and assign them to the correct employee using the Zoho ID match from RC_BI_Database.dbo.zoho_Employee

If necessary, export both datasets and do a manual reconciliation.

âœ… Step 4: Re-index and clear cache

After remapping, purge the frontend/backend cache

Ensure real-time API response reflects updated employee names and messages
