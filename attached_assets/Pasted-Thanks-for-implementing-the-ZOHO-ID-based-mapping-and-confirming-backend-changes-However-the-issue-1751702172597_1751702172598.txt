Thanks for implementing the ZOHO ID-based mapping and confirming backend changes. However, the issue is still not resolved on our end. Chat messages are either:

Not appearing at all in the report

Still showing under the wrong employee names

Or showing incorrectly despite the backend SQL verification

At this point, the problem appears to be incomplete integration between your fixed backend mapping and the frontend report logic.

üö® Please urgently verify and confirm the following:
‚úÖ 1. Is the report using employee_zoho_mapping.ZohoID as the basis for joining chat messages to employees?
If it's still referencing employee_id or some outdated internal ID, this must be corrected in the JOIN logic.

‚úÖ 2. Please validate the final report query being used in the frontend (or reporting tool) ‚Äî it should join like this:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ...
FROM chat_messages cm
JOIN employee_zoho_mapping ezm ON cm.employee_id = ezm.internal_id
JOIN RC_BI_Database.dbo.zoho_Employee ze ON ezm.zoho_id = ze.ZohoID
‚úÖ 3. Confirm if the frontend/reporting layer is using cached data.
If you are using any in-memory or browser-side caching, please invalidate or refresh it. Otherwise, the data shown to the user may still reflect the old mappings.

‚úÖ 4. Confirm actual visibility of the below messages:

Please check in the actual report view if the following test entries are correctly mapped:

"Currently partially billable on the Petbarn project..." ‚Üí Should appear under Praveen M G (Zoho: 10012260)

"HD Supply comment..." ‚Üí Should appear under Mohammad Abdul Wahab Khan (Zoho: 10114331)

‚úÖ 5. Reconfirm frontend and backend are both using consistent employee identity columns.
If employee_id in chat_messages is still used as primary reference in frontend rendering (instead of ZohoID), it will break the attribution visually even if SQL backend is correct.

üîÅ Request:
Please share the final SQL or API logic powering the report view, so we can confirm that it reflects the updated ZOHO ID mappings implemented in your employee_zoho_mapping table.

Until the data in the actual report visibly shows chat messages under correct employee names, this issue cannot be considered resolved ‚Äî regardless of backend fix logs.
